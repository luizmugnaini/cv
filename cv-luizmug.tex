\section{About me}

I'm an undergraduate student in \href{https://www.cecm.usp.br/}{Molecular
  Sciences} at the University of Sao Paulo specialising in mathematics and
computer science. Together with my adviser
\href{https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru/}{Ivan Struchiner} we are currently
studying abstract homotopy theory via model categories.

\section{Interests}

As a scientist I'm eager to build bridges between the abstract realm of
\emph{mathematics} and \emph{computer science}, more specifically in the field
of \emph{machine learning} and \emph{data science} at large. Aside from
academic research, I'm looking forward for an \emph{internship} where I would be
able to \emph{learn} how to \emph{apply} these techniques at the \emph{industry} level.

\section{Education}

\begin{twenty}

    {B.Sc. Molecular Sciences}
    {University of Sao Paulo}
    {Molecular Sciences is a bachelor degree at the University of Sao Paulo for
    specially selected students focusing on the interplay of computer science,
    mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry. The structure of the course is
    build so that the students have the freedom of research by combining
    multiple topics of interest. My weighted average grade is 9.2/10.}

    {Since 2022}{
    \href{https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-10447-3}
    {\textcolor{mainblue}{Simplicial \& Dendroidal Homotopy Theory}}

    My \emph{undergraduate research} project focuses on the study of
    \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Homotopy+Theory}{\emph{homotopy
      theory}} via the lenses of simplicial sets, dendroidal sets and model
    categories. Most of my progress can be found in my publicly available
    \href{https://luizmugnaini.github.io/deep-dive}{research notes}.

      \href{https://luizmugnaini.github.io/2d-tqft-frobenius}
      {\textcolor{mainblue}{2D Topological Quantum Field Theory \& Frobenius Algebras}}

      As a final project for my
      \href{https://sites.google.com/view/cristian-ortiz/usp2022-math-physics}{\emph{mathematical-physics
          class}}, I decided to study the categorical equivalence between
      2-dimensional topological quantum field theories and the category of
      commutative Frobenius algebras. The paper can be found
      \href{https://luizmugnaini.github.io/2d-tqft-frobenius}{here}.

    \twentymiditem
    {~~~~~~2022}{
      \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/numerical}
      {\textcolor{mainblue}{Numerical Methods}}

      As a final project for my \emph{numerical methods} class, I've developed
      together with two colleages an \emph{open source Python package}
      \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/numerical}{\texttt{numerical}}.

      \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/chirp}
      {\textcolor{mainblue}{CHIP-8 interpreter}}

      As a personal project aiming to know the ways of \emph{hardware
        emulation}, I developed
      a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8}{CHIP-8} interpreter in
      \emph{Rust}---the project can be
      found \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/chirp}{here}.

    {~~~~~~2022}{
      \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/radiant}
      {\textcolor{mainblue}{Ray tracing}}

      Wishing to understand more about \emph{computer graphics} and rendering
      techniques, I implemented
      a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)}{ray tracer}
      in \emph{Rust}---the project can be
      found \href{https://github.com/luizmugnaini/radiant}{here}.
